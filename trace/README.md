# trace.js Overview

The `trace.js` file is responsible for managing and displaying trace information during the execution of dynamic forms. It provides a mechanism to track and visualize the inputs, outputs, and intermediate states of the decision service engine, enabling developers and analysts to debug and understand the form's behavior.

## Key Features

1. **Trace Management**:
   - Captures and stores inputs, outputs, and form data for each stage of the form's lifecycle.
   - Maintains a history of all stages for easy navigation and debugging.

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Listens to custom events raised during the form's execution, such as `BEFORE_START`, `NEW_FORM_DATA_SAVED`, and `BEFORE_DS_EXECUTION`.
   - Updates the trace panel dynamically based on these events.

3. **Trace Panel UI**:
   - Displays the following in a structured format:
     - Inputs to the decision service.
     - Outputs from the decision service.
     - Accrued form data at each stage.
   - Provides navigation through the trace history using clickable stage links.

4. **History Navigation**:
   - Allows users to switch between saved stages and view the corresponding inputs, outputs, and form data.

## Key Functions

- **setupTracing**: Initializes the trace system by registering event handlers for various custom events.
- **_clearTraceData**: Clears all trace data and resets the trace panel.
- **_traceDecisionServiceInputs**: Captures and displays the inputs sent to the decision service.
- **_traceDecisionServiceResults**: Captures and displays the outputs received from the decision service.
- **_traceFormData**: Captures and displays the form data saved at each stage.
- **_switchToSavedStage**: Handles navigation to a previously saved stage in the trace history.

## Usage

The `trace.js` file is automatically integrated into the dynamic forms system. It listens for events raised during the form's lifecycle and updates the trace panel accordingly. Developers can use the trace panel to debug and analyze the decision-making process of the form.

---

## Integration

- **Custom Events**: The file relies on custom events defined in `customEvents.js` to capture and update trace information.
- **UI Elements**: The trace panel is rendered in the HTML and interacts with the DOM to display trace data dynamically.

By providing a detailed trace of the form's execution, `trace.js` simplifies debugging and ensures transparency in the decision-making process.
